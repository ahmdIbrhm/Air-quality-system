# Air quality control

In this project we provide a data gathering scenario by exposing some measuring stations
(Temperature, Pressure, Dust) in different places in Saint-Etienne. We configure the sensors
to be able to transmit data instantaneously. The data is stored maintaining interoperability
and it is highly interchangeable in a machine readable manner where it could be useful for
any future use-cases such as simple and complex queries or even data analysis.

The expected results are acquiring data from measurement stations that will be found in a
database on the Territory Platform of Ecole des Mines de Sainte Etienne. A mobile appli-
cation is used to configure the sensors and deploy them in a specific place in the city. In
addition to that, a web-page is used to visualize these stored data.
The objectives of this project are the following:
• Store history information about air quality in different stations deployed at different
places in the city.
• Visualize the history of measurements of a specific station.
• Visualize the current state of air quality on a specific station on a map.
• Deploy a new station in any place.
• Shift any station’s location on run time.
